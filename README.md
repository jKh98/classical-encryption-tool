# Classical Encryption Tool
This is a ReactJS educational web application for cryptography class. This web app can be exported as a static webpage or as an ElectronJS execuable.

## About
The app covers most of the classical encryption techniques such as: 

* Affine cipher
* Euclid Algorithm
* Hill cipher
* Mono-Alphabetic cipher
* Playfair cipher
* Vignere cipher

For each cipher, user can transform plaintext to ciphertext and vice versa. The user also has the option to display cipher and plain text in the folowing formats:

* binary format
* hexadecimal format
* ascii

The app aslo shows a graph showing alphabet dissemination for each cipher.

## Usage
* `<npm install>` to install all requiredd dependencies
* `<npm start>` to start the local server (this project uses create-react-app)
* `<npm run electron-pack>` to build a windows installer executable
